This is a demo of the Dash interactive Python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

Dash abstracts away all of the technologies and protocols required to build an interactive web-based application and is a simple and effective way to bind a user interface around your Python code.

When you run `app.py`, it will say that the app is running on http://localhost:8050. However, by default it will be at http://localhost:8050/dash/gallery/stock-tickers. This can be configured by editing `base_url_pathname`.

To learn more check out our [documentation](https://plot.ly/dash).

The following is a screenshot for the app in this repo:
