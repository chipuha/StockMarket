This started from a [demo](https://github.com/plotly/dash-stock-tickers-demo-app) of the Dash interactive Python framework developed by [Plotly](https://plot.ly/).

To run, first check you have the correct packages. Be inside the folder `/stock-advisor`. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get all the packages you need. Second, start up the application by entering `python app.py`. The application is now running at http://localhost:8050, so open a web brower and start visualizing!

The following is a screenshot for the demo repo:
