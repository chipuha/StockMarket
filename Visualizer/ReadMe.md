# Visualizer
We need a single application to house, run, compare, and analysis the different models. A web app is nice due to it's flexibility, but mostly because you can get sick css styling for the app.

### **Phase 1**
Pick a web app library: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) looks promising and seems to be well documented. The intro tutorial is LONG but doable.

### **Phase 2**
Follow a Model-View-Controller design by deciding what the model will be (stock trading models/data/graphs/text), some basic view styles, and how we want to control the view (think interaction between view and model)

### **Phase 3**
Make wicked cool sytling scheme
