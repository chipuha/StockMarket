# Visualizer
We need a single application to house, run, compare, and analysis the different models. A web app is a natural choice due to it's flexibility and availability but mostly we're choosing it because you can get sick css styling.

### *Phase 1*
Pick a web app library: [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) looks promising and seems to be well documented. The intro tutorial is LONG but doable.

### *Phase 2*
Follow a Model-View-Controller design by deciding what the model will be (stock trading models/data/graphs/text), some basic view styles, and how we want to control the view (think interaction between view and model).

### *Phase 3*
Make wicked cool sytling scheme.
