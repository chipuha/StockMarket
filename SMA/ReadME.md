# The Simple Moving Average

* What an SMA tells you: trends but does not predict future prices.
* Strength: confirms past trends.
* Weakness: Does not predict future. Sensitive to the window you average over.
* Possible improvements: try different evaluation metrics? (right now it's max dropdown and Sharpe ratio)
